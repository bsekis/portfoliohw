                <p>My name is Ben Ekis. I grew up in the small town of Naples, NY located in the Finger Lakes region of New York State. I spent my years there playing sports and creating artwork for friends and family. Nowadays, instead of playing sports I watch them on television. When I’m not doing that I work full time at a butcher for The Fresh Market and still enjoy creating art. Since I still feel very new to the Charlotte, NC area I enjoy exploring as much as I can. Hiking, camping and photographing the outdoors has become another passion of mine in recent years and I look forward to continuing to do so in a new area with such a vast array of landscapes and scenery. Please feel free to reach out to me via the ‘contact’ section of this page and I’ll be in touch as soon as possible. Thank you! </p>
